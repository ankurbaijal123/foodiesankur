                <div className="font-semibold mb-3">1. Scope of Service</div>
                <div className="mb-8" style={{fontSize:'15px'}}>1.1. These terms and conditions are subject to occasional changes and apply to all our services that are directly or indirectly provided (i.e. via third parties) via the internet, on mobile devices, by email or by telephone.<br></br>

                    2.2. In addition, users have the possibility of purchasing the selected medicine through a direct connection to the pharmacy sites (third parties). As a result, the purchase will be made directly on the pharmacy site and not on the SmartPills sites. In such cases, SmartPills is not the pharmacy or the contractual party for the user, but only an agent providing the technical connection to the pharmacy site of a third party. By making a purchase on the website of the third party, users agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of that pharmacy site. These terms and conditions can be viewed on the website of the third party. Once a purchase is made on the website of a third party, a contract is concluded between the pharmacy site and the user, and therefore no contract is concluded between the user and SmartPills. SmartPills is no contractual party to the medicine purchase and all and any claims of the user under the medicine purchase are to be asserted against the third party (the pharmacy site) and not against SmartPills.<br></br>
                    2.3. This agreement is not affected by any other agreements between the pharmacy and users.</div>
